                Smart NFTs, a capstone project by Florencia Petrikovich and Gonzalo Hirsch. Create, deploy, and test a custom NFT contract in just
                minutes. We offer the option of creating your own NFT and interacting with previously created tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
                When creating an NFT, you can select and combine multiple options. Don't worry if you don't know what each option means; we are here
                to help! Just look for the question mark icons to guide you to our help section. We support automatic progress saving, contract
                compilation, contract verification, and deployment to test networks such as Ropsten and Rinkeby. Our intuitive and fast UI will guide
                you through the whole process without trouble. Smart NFTs also supports metadata; you can define your metadata schema, and we take
                care of everything when minting (creating) your token.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you feel your NFT is ready, you can interact with it (after deploying it to a test network). We support all the methods exposed
                by the deployed contract using an intuitive UI. Each option is explained by experts, helping you to understand both the meaning and
                how to use it. If you need to upload metadata when minting, we've got you covered! All you need is the image (or file) you want to
                attach to the token, and we'll do the rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the services mentioned, this is a curated source of information regarding Smart Contracts and serves as the perfect
                starting point for beginners looking to dive into the world of Ethereum and Smart Contracts.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a bonus, you don't even need to have an Ethereum wallet to use our application, making it easier to grasp for everyone. It has all
                the benefits of a Web3 application, without the difficulties of both understanding it and having the hardware to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you ever get tired of using our UI, you can use our public API by checking out the documentation, or if you feel adventurous, you
                can build your UI on top of our API.
